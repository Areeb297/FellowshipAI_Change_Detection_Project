## Developing Siamese Networks with Pre-trained Models

The code contained in this repository demonstrates the creation of Siamese Networks in PyTorch by leveraging pre-trained models, enabling the training process to utilize bi-temporal images and produce change masks that are beneficial for disaster detection. The LEVIR-CD Dataset, a large-scale remote sensing building Change Detection dataset, is employed for this purpose. This newly introduced dataset serves as a benchmark for assessing change detection (CD) algorithms, particularly those founded on deep learning techniques.

Implemented a pre-trained Siamese Network using Convolutional Neural Networks, Attention mechanism, Transformers and more, called ![SarasNET](https://github.com/f64051041/SARAS-Net) to apply on satellite imagery data to develop a change detection model. The SarasNET is fine-tuned on different datasets such as CDD dataset to output relevant change masks.
