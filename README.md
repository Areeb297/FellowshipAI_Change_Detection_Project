### The code contained in this repository demonstrates the creation of Siamese Networks in PyTorch by leveraging pre-trained models, enabling the training process to utilize bi-temporal images and produce change masks that are beneficial for disaster detection. The LEVIR-CD Dataset, a large-scale remote sensing building Change Detection dataset, is employed for this purpose. This newly introduced dataset serves as a benchmark for assessing change detection (CD) algorithms, particularly those founded on deep learning techniques.
